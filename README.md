# panel.py

`panel.py` is replacement for the shell-based default panel of *herbstluftwm*.
It is a proof-of-concept script to test the idea of dynamic tag names.

## Dynamic tag names

The idea is to have each tag named after the windows the tag hosts, ie. your "desktop" running *sup*
and *mplayer* is called `mplayer+sup`. There's a pleasant nicknack: if you `set title` in your `.vimrc`,
you'll get tags called after the file you currently edit with *vim*!

## Project status

This is a new think, so:

  * No multiple screens support
  * Code needs refactoring
  * Need to change code to customize status text
  * All suggestions and contributions welcome
